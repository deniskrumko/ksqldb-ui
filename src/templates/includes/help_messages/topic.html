A topic in Apache Kafka is a category or feed name to which messages are published. Topics are partitioned and replicated across multiple brokers for scalability and fault tolerance. Producers write data to topics, and consumers read data from topics. Each topic consists of one or more partitions, and messages within a partition are ordered by offset.
