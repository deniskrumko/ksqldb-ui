{% trans %}Query is a continuous SQL statement that processes real-time data from streams (basically, events from Kafka topics), transforming or filtering it into new streams or tables. Unlike traditional SQL, ksqlDB queries run continuously and update results as new events arrive.<br><br>Queries with prefix <code>CSAS_</code> means that they were created using <code>CREATE STREAM ... AS SELECT</code> SQL statements.<br>Queries with name <code>INSERTQUERY_</code> were created using <code>INSERT INTO ... SELECT</code> SQL statements.{% endtrans %}
